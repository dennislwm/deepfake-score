## Hypothesis
**deepfake-score** was a personal project to:

### Non-existant viable feature
- generate an article from a phrase using DeepAI and test its readability

### Non-existant bloat
- (optional) compare scores of various Deep AI machines

## Methodology

This is the minimum viable product (MVP) to test the above hypothesis.

* generate an article from a phrase using DeepAI and test its readability

### Existing viable feature

* generate a body of text using DeepAI's API (Parm2020)
* test readability using Text Standard (Moye2020)

---
## Complexity

Count the cost of complexity, i.e. incremental reward and risk reduction, before evolving MVP.

### Existing bloat 

Test readability using (Moye2020):
* Flesch Reading Ease
* Smog Index
* Flesch Kincaid Grade
* Coleman Liau Index
* Automated Readability Index
* Dale Chall Readability Score 
* Difficult Words 
* Linsear Write Formula
* Gunning Fog
